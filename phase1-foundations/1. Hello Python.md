# Phase 1 — Foundations
## Prompt #1: Hello Python — Your First Script
## Objective

Learn how to:

Write and run your first Python program

Understand the role of __name__ == "__main__"

Use print statements and string formatting

## Concept

Every Python program starts executing from the top of a file, but when your script grows into a module (imported by others), you don’t want some parts to run automatically.

That’s where:

if __name__ == "__main__":


comes in — it tells Python “Run this block only if this file is executed directly, not when it’s imported.”

This lets you structure your code cleanly, keeping executable logic and reusable functions separate.

## Exercise

Create a file named main.py with the following requirements:

Define a function greet(name: str) that prints:

Hello, <name>! Welcome to Python.


In the main block, ask the user for their name using input(), then call greet() with it.

Use the __main__ pattern properly.

## Example Solution
### main.py
```bash
def greet(name: str):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
    greet(user_name)
```
## How to Run

In your terminal:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## Output:

Enter your name: Alex
Hello, Alex! Welcome to Python.

## Reflection

Why does __name__ == "__main__" matter?
Because when Python runs a file, it sets the variable __name__:

If run directly, __name__ = "__main__"

If imported as a module, __name__ = "filename"

So you can reuse this file later without triggering code unintentionally.
