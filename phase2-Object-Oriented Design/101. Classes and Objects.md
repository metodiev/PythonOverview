# Classes and Objects
##Goal

Understand how to define classes, create objects, and encapsulate state and behavior in Python.

## Concept

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
An object (or instance) is a specific realization of that class with its own attributes and methods.

Python classes are defined using the class keyword.
Attributes hold state, methods define behavior.
```bash
## Basic Syntax
class Person:
    # Constructor / initializer
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # instance attribute
        self.age = age

    # Method
    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."

# Create objects (instances)
alice = Person("Alice", 30)
bob = Person("Bob", 25)

print(alice.greet())
print(bob.greet())
```

Output:

Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old.

## Exercise

- Create a class Car with attributes: make, model, year. 
- Add a method description() that returns a string describing the car.
- Instantiate 2–3 different cars and print their descriptions.
- Experiment: add a new attribute color to one instance after creation — what happens?

## Reflection

- How do classes in Python differ from plain dictionaries or lists for storing data?
- What is self, and why is it required in method definitions?
- How can you add behavior to all instances versus individual instances?
